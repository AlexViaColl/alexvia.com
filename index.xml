      <description>In the last post, we created a simple program to open an X11 window. Today, we will learn how to initialize and use OpenGL to clear the window with a color.

And the result: Linking with OpenGL In order to use OpenGL we need to include the following headers:
#include &amp;lt;X11/Xutil.h&amp;gt;	// Required to use XVisualInfo #include &amp;lt;GL/gl.h&amp;gt; // OpenGL types and functions like GLuint or glClear #include &amp;lt;GL/glx.h&amp;gt;	// OpenGL X Window bindings like glXCreateContext  And we also need to tell the compiler to link with OpenGL:
# using pkg-config gcc -o x11_opengl `pkg-config --libs x11 gl` x11_opengl.</description>

      <title>Opening a Window in X11</title>

      <description>The X Window System is a windowing system commonly used in UNIX-based operating systems. The latest version of X is version 11 (released 2012), that&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s often abbreviated as X11.
X11 is based on a client-server architecture. The server is the one who has direct access over the hardware devices such as the monitor screens, the keyboard and the mouse. Client applications should make requests to the server in order to achieve any kind of graphical output to the screen.
X is not the only Window System available for Linux and other UNIX-like operating systems. Wayland is a more modern project with the aim of replacing X.</description>

      <title>8 Uses of Pointers in C</title>

      <description>At a fundamental level a pointer is just a number which represents a memory address. The size of a pointer depends on the platform, for 64 bit platforms the size is 64 bits (8 bytes) and for 32 bit platforms the size is 32 bits (4 bytes), but the size is always the same for a given platform regardless of the pointer&amp;rsquo;s type.
printf(&amp;quot;%d\n&amp;quot;, sizeof(int*)); printf(&amp;quot;%d\n&amp;quot;, sizeof(char*)); printf(&amp;quot;%d\n&amp;quot;, sizeof(void*)); printf(&amp;quot;%d\n&amp;quot;, sizeof(MyCustomType*));  A memory address specifies the location of a single byte in memory, if we wanted to read only a single bit from memory, we would have to read a whole byte and then do some bit twiddling to extract the bit we were interested in.</description>

Hugo supports TOML, YAML and JSON data file types, Markdown and HTML content files and uses shortcodes to add rich content. Other notable features are taxonomies, multilingual mode, image processing, custom output formats, HTML/CSS/JS minification and support for Sass SCSS workflows.
Hugo makes use of a variety of open source projects including:
 https://github.com/yuin/goldmark https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma https://github.com/muesli/smartcrop https://github.com/spf13/cobra https://github.com/spf13/viper  Hugo is ideal for blogs, corporate websites, creative portfolios, online magazines, single page applications or even a website with thousands of pages.
Hugo is for people who want to hand code their own website without worrying about setting up complicated runtimes, dependencies and databases.</description>
