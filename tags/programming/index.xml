      <description>Following up on the last post, I continue to solve Advent of Code puzzles using a different programming language every day.
You can find my solutions on GitHub:

For the second week I chose languages which I had never used before.
Day 6 - Perl Day 7 - Ada Day 8 - PHP Day 9 - D Day 10 - Nim Day 11 - Julia Day 12 - Dart After struggling with functional languages last time, this second week has been a bit easier. I got used to the new languages pretty fast, as they share many concepts with other languages that I&amp;rsquo;m already familiar with.</description>

      <description>Advent of Code is an online Advent calendar where you have to solve two small programming puzzles, of increasing difficulty, every day from December 1st to the 25th.
Last year, I solved most of the problems using Rust. The challenge for this year is to use a different programming language every day, based on Tsoding.
You can find my solutions on GitHub: 
For the first 5 days I decided to use functional programming languages (mostly).
Day 1 - Haskell Day 2 - Ruby Day 3 - OCaml Day 4 - Scala Day 5 - Erlang This first week turned out to be quite a challenge.</description>
